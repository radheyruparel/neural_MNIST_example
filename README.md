# Deep Neural Network Using MNIST Example

The dataset used in this program is called MNIST and refers to handwritten digit recognition. The dataset provides 70,000 images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (1 digit per image). The goal of this algorithm is to detect which digit is written in the dataset. Since there are only 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), this is a classification problem with 10 classes. Therefore algorithm builds a neural network with 2 hidden layers, using Kesar and TensorFlow packages in python. Showing how I can build a deep neural networks in python.
